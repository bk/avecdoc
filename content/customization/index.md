title: Customizing AvecCSS
subtitle: AvecCSS is easy to extend and modify
---

- AvecCSS responds automatically to your [dark mode](themes/) setting.

- A lot of customization can be done by modifying the [CSS variables](variables/) used by AvecCSS.

- You can modify the CSS classes and rules in AvecCSS by overriding them in your own CSS file.

- Similarly, if you want to create your own [color theme](themes/) without touching SCSS, it is quite easy to modify one of the theme files and save it under a new name.

- If you need to customize AvecCSS beyond this, the best way is to [clone the project](https://github.com/bk/aveccss) and change the SCSS source.
