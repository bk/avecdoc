## Images

`<img>` and `<video>` elements have a `max-width` of 100%.

The `<figcaption>` of a `<figure>` is shown centered below the image, in smaller type.

## Aside

An `<aside>` has a border, a discreet background and smaller text.

In breakpoint `sm` and above (and if it is inside either `<div>` or `<p>`) it also floats to the right and takes up 30% of the available space.
